		 CHANGES IN vcolmm VERSION 0.1-10

NEW FEATURES

     o   added 'type = "terms"' to predict 'predict.tvcolmm'
     	 - allows to extract the effect of the model
	 corresponding to an observation.

IMPROVEMENTS

     o	 C implementation for updating the marginal Likelihood
     	 and predicting random-effects was stabilized by 
	 replacing many alloca's by the R built-in function
	 Calloc, which may slow the estimation
