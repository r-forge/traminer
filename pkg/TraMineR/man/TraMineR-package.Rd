Trajectory miner: a toolbox for exploring and rendering sequence data
}
\description{
This package is a toolbox for sequence manipulation, description, rendering and more generally the mining of sequence data in the field of social sciences. Though it is primarily intended for analyzing state or event sequences that describe life courses such as family formation histories or professional careers its features also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. It accepts many different sequence representations as input and provides tools for translating sequences from one format to another. It offers several statistical functions for describing and rendering sequences, for computing distances between sequences with different metrics among which optimal matching, the longest common prefix and the longest common subsequence, and simple functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and identifying the most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be found on TraMineR's web page.

TraMineR provides tools for both state sequences and event
sequences. The first step when using the package is to define a
state sequence object (with \code{\link{seqdef}}) if you want to
explore state sequences, and an event sequence object (with
\code{\link{seqecreate}}) if you are interested in event
sequencing.

State sequences are defined from a series of variables giving the
states at the successive positions, while event sequences are
defined from (vertical) time stamped event data. The package,
however, can handle many other different data organizations and
provides tools to help converting state sequences into event
sequences and vice versa.
