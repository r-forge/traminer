Trajectory miner, a toolbox for exploring and rendering sequence data
}
\description{
This package is a toolbox for sequence manipulation, description, rendering and more generally the mining of sequence data in the field of social sciences. Though it is primarily intended for analyzing state or event sequences that describe life courses such as family formation histories or professional careers its features indeed also apply to many other kinds of categorical sequence data. It accepts as input many different sequence representations and provides tools for translating sequences from one format to another. It offers several statistical functions for describing and rendering sequences, for computing distances between sequences with different metrics among which optimal matching, the longest common prefix and the longest common subsequence, and simple functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and identifying the most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be found on TraMineR's web page.

TraMineR proposes tools for both state sequences and event sequences. The first step when using the package is to define a state sequence object (with \code{\link{seqdef}})  if you want to explore state sequences, and an event sequence object (with \code{\link{seqecreate}}) if you are interested in event sequencing.

State sequences are defined from a series of variables giving the states at the successive positions, while event sequences are defined from time stamped event data.
The package, however, can handle many other different data organizations and provides tools to help converting state sequences into event sequences and vice versa.
