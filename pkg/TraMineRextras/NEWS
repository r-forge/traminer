Changes in version 0.2 [2012-11-24]

    - First release on CRAN

Changes in existing functions
    
    - seqentrans(): new option avg.occ; when set as TRUE the table is completed with
        average number of occurrences of the subsequences in each sequence. 
        The latter differs from the support for counting methods other than COBJ.
        Requires TraMineR 1.8.5 or higher.
    - dissvar.grp() and seqrep.grp() now also accept distance object as mdis argument.
    - group.p has now a weights argument.

Bug Fixes
   
    - seqedist(): fixed a mix between norm and interval arguments. 
    - fixed build warning generated by calls of foreign functions.
