		 CHANGES IN tvcm VERSION 0.1-15

GENERAL

    o    complete revision of the syntax, argument names and 
         default parameters. R codes of version 0.1-14 will likely 
         not work anymore.
    o    the default splitting criterion of 'tvcm' was changed from 
         coefficient constancy tests combined with greedy loss 
         minimization to exclusive greedy loss minimization. Splitting 
         based on the former default require to set the argument 
         'sctest' in 'tvcm_control'

NEW FEATURES
     
     o   'tvcm' and 'fvcm' allow for multiple 'vc' terms.
     

IMPROVEMENTS

     o	 the greedy loss reduction minimization stage of 'tvcm' does now 
         fixate coefficients which are not splitted at the estimates of 
         the current model. The technique intends acceleration.
