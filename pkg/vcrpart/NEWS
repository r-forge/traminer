		 CHANGES IN tvcm VERSION 0.2-1

GENERAL

    o    complete revision of syntaxes, argument names and 
         default parameters. R commands for the former version 0.1-14 
         are hardly compatibel. Please contact reto.buergin@unige.ch 
         in case of questions.
    o    the default splitting criterion of 'tvcm' was changed from 
         (old) coefficient constancy tests combined with greedy loss 
         minimization to (new) exhaustive greedy loss minimization. Splitting 
         based on the (old) requires to set the argument 'sctest = TRUE' in 
         'tvcm_control'

NEW FEATURES
     
     o   'tvcm' and 'fvcm' allow for multiple 'vc' terms.
     

IMPROVEMENTS

     o	 the greedy loss reduction minimization stage of 'tvcm' does now 
         fixate coefficients which are not splitted at the estimates of 
         the current model. The technique intends acceleration.

     o   cross-validation is now integrated in the 'tvcm' function.

     o   several functions such as 'cvloss' are parallelized by using the
         'parallel' package.
