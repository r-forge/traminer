Changes in Version 0.2-1

    o   First CRAN release.

    o   'tvcm' and 'fvcm' allow for multiple 'vc' terms, i.e. 
        coefficient-specific partitions

    o    Complete revision of syntaxes, argument names and  default 
         parameters. R commands for the former version 0.1-14 are 
         hardly compatibel. Please contact <rbuergin@gmx.ch> 
         in case of questions.

    o    The default splitting criterion of 'tvcm' was changed from 
         (old) coefficient constancy tests combined with greedy loss 
         minimization to (new) exhaustive greedy loss minimization. Splitting 
         based on the (old) requires to set the argument 'sctest = TRUE' in 
         'tvcm_control'

     o	 The greedy loss reduction minimization stage of 'tvcm' does now 
         fixate coefficients which are not splitted at the estimates of 
         the current model. The technique intends acceleration.

     o   Cross-validation is now integrated in the 'tvcm' function.

     o   'cvloss' and 'prune' are parallelized using the 'parallel' package.
