	splines ({MARS}) is a nonparametric method that estimates complex
	nonlinear relationships by a series of spline functions of the independent
	predictors. {T}he specific aim of this study is to construct {MARS}
	models based on heart rate ({HR}) and accelerometer counts ({AC})
	to accurately predict {EE}, and hence 24-h total {EE} ({TEE}), in
	children and adolescents. {S}econdarily, {MARS} models will be developed
	to predict awake {EE}, sleep {EE}, and activity {EE} also from {HR}
	and {AC}. {MARS} models were developed in 109 and validated in 61
	normal-weight and overweight children (ages 5-18 yr) against the
	criterion method of 24-h room respiration calorimetry. {A}ctiheart
	monitor was used to measure {HR} and {AC}. {MARS} models were based
	on linear combinations of 23-28 basis functions that use subject
	characteristics (age, sex, weight, height, minimal {HR}, and sitting
	{HR}), {HR} and {AC}, 1- and 2-min lag and lead values of {HR} and
	{AC}, and appropriate interaction terms. {F}or the 24-h, awake, sleep,
	and activity {EE} models, mean percent errors were -2.5 7.5, -2.6
	7.8, -0.3 8.9, and -11.9 17.9\%, and root mean square error values
	were 168, 138, 40, and 122 kcal, respectively, in the validation
	cohort. {B}land-{A}ltman plots indicated that the predicted values
	were in good agreement with the observed {TEE}, and that there was
	no bias with increasing {TEE}. {P}rediction errors for 24-h {TEE}
	were not statistically associated with age, sex, weight, height,
	or body mass index. {MARS} models developed for the prediction of
	{EE} from {HR} monitoring and accelerometry were demonstrated to
	be valid in an independent cohort of children and adolescents, but
	require further validation in independent, free-living populations.},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:{M}odern methods in intensive care medicine often enable
	the survival of older critically ill patients. {T}he short-term outcomes
	for patients treated in intensive care units ({ICU}s), such as survival
	to hospital discharge, are well documented. {H}owever, relatively
	little is known about subsequent long-term outcomes. {P}ain, anxiety
	and agitation are important stress factors for many critically ill
	patients. {T}here are very few studies concerned with pain, anxiety
	and agitation and the consequences in older critically ill patients.
	{T}he overall aim of this study is to identify how an {ICU} stay
	influences an older person's experiences later in life. {M}ore specific,
	this study has the following objectives: (1) to explore the relationship
	between pain, anxiety and agitation during {ICU} stays and experiences
	of the same symptoms in later life; and (2) to explore the associations
	between pain, anxiety and agitation experienced during {ICU} stays
	and their effect on subsequent health-related quality of life, use
	of the health care system (readmissions, doctor visits, rehabilitation,
	medication use), living situation, and survival after discharge and
	at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.{METHODS}/{DESIGN}:{A} prospective,
	longitudinal study will be used for this study. {A} total of 150
	older critically ill patients in the {ICU} will participate ({ICU}
	group). {P}ain, anxiety, agitation, morbidity, mortality, use of
	the health care system, and health-related quality of life will be
	measured at 3 intervals after a baseline assessment. {B}aseline measurements
	will be taken 48 hours after {ICU} admission and one week thereafter.
	{F}ollow-up measurements will take place 6 months and 12 months after
	discharge from the {ICU}. {T}o be able to interpret trends in scores
	on outcome variables in the {ICU} group, a comparison group of 150
	participants, matched by age and gender, recruited from the {S}wiss
	population, will be interviewed at the same intervals as the {ICU}
	group.{DISCUSSION}:{L}ittle research has focused on long term consequences
	after {ICU} admission in older critically ill patients. {T}he present
	study is specifically focussing on long term consequences of stress
	factors experienced during {ICU} admission.{TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}:{ISRCTN}52754370},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {{Longitudinal data refer to the situation where repeated observations
	are available for each sampled object. Clustered data, where observations
	are nested in a hierarchical structure within objects (without time
	necessarily being involved) represent a similar type of situation.
	Methodologies that take this structure into account allow for the
	possibilities of systematic differences between objects that are
	not related to attributes and autocorrelation within objects across
	time periods. A standard methodology in the statistics literature
	for this type of data is the mixed effects model, where these differences
	between objects are represented by so-called random effects that
	are estimated from the data (population-level relationships are termed
	fixed effects, together resulting in a mixed effects model). This
	paper presents a methodology that combines the structure of mixed
	effects models for longitudinal and clustered data with the flexibility
	of tree-based estimation methods. We apply the resulting estimation
	method, called the RE-EM tree, to pricing in online transactions,
	showing that the RE-EM tree is less sensitive to parametric assumptions
	and provides improved predictive power compared to linear models
	with random effects and regression trees without random effects.
	We also apply it to a smaller data set examining accident fatalities,
	and show that the RE-EM tree strongly outperforms a tree without
	random effects while performing comparably to a linear model with
	random effects. We also perform extensive simulation experiments
	to show that the estimator improves predictive performance relative
	to regression trees without random effects and is comparable or superior
	to using linear models with random effects in more general situations.}},

	apply however to any kind of objects and measures of dissimilarities.
	{W}e start with a generalization of the analysis of variance ({ANOVA})
	to assess the link of complex objects (e.g. sequences) with a given
	categorical variable. {T}he trick is to show that discrepancy among
	objects can be derived from the sole pairwise dissimilarities, which
	permits then to identify factors that most reduce this discrepancy.
	{W}e present a general statistical test and introduce an original
	way of rendering the results for state sequences. {W}e then generalize
	the method to the case with more than one factor and discuss its

	and individual quality-of-life outcomes of low-vision rehabilitation.
	{STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}: {I}n a nonrandomized longitudinal
	design, visually impaired older patients (n=296) were referred to
	multidisciplinary rehabilitation or to an optometric service. {T}he
	five-dimensional {L}ow {V}ision {Q}uality of {L}ife {Q}uestionnaire
	was administered at four time points. {T}he {IRT} model was characterized
	by the graded response model for rating scales. {C}ovariates were
	added to the model, mainly to correct for missing data. {T}he invariance
	assumption across time points was investigated. {RESULTS}: {A}verage
	and individual rehabilitation effects were estimated. {F}or multidisciplinary
	rehabilitation, significant average deterioration was seen on three
	dimensions after 4.4 years. {M}any individuals in the optometric
	service group significantly improved on the "reading small print"
	dimension (18.5\%); in both groups, many individuals significantly
	deteriorated on "visual (motor) skills" (22.2-30.0\%). {I}nvariance
	across time points could be assumed for all dimensions, except for
	"adjustment." {G}ender, education, visual acuity, and health status
	were significantly associated with the outcome. {CONCLUSION}: {W}e
	present how a multilevel {IRT} model can be applied to describe longitudinal
	dependent vision-related quality-of-life data, while focusing on
	average and individual effects.},

  abstract = {{S}-{PLUS} is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical
	analysis of data. {I}t provides the tools to implement many statistical
	ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability
	of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities.
	{T}his book is a guide to using {S}-{PLUS} to perform statistical
	analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of {S}-{PLUS}
	and a course in modern statistical methods. {S}-{PLUS} is available
	for both {W}indows and {UNIX} workstations, and both versions are
	covered in depth. {T}he aim of the book is to show how to use {S}-{PLUS}
	as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. {R}eaders are assumed
	to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended
	for would-be users of {S}-{PLUS} and both students and researchers
	using statistics. {T}hroughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical
	problems and full analyses of real data sets. {M}any of the methods
	discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear,
	nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate
	analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series
	and spatial statistics. {T}hroughout, modern techniques such as robust
	methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where
	appropriate. {T}his third edition is intended for users of {S}-{PLUS}
	4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although {S}-{PLUS} 3.3/4 are also considered.
	{T}he major change from the second edition is coverage of the current
	versions of {S}-{PLUS}. {T}he material has been extensively rewritten
	using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods.
	{T}he companion volume on {S} {P}rogramming will provide an in-depth
	guide for those writing software in the {S} language. {T}he authors
	have written several software libraries that enhance {S}-{PLUS};
	these and all the datasets used are available on the {I}nternet in
	versions for {W}indows and {UNIX}. {T}here are extensive on-line
	complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions,
	further exercises, and new features of {S}-{PLUS} as they are introduced.
