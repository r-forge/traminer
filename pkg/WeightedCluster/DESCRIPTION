Description: Clusters state sequences and weighted data. It provides an optimized weighted PAM algorithm as well as functions for aggregating replicated cases, computing cluster quality measures for a range of clustering solutions and plotting (fuzzy) clusters of state sequences. Parametric bootstraps methods to validate typology of sequences are also provided. Finally, it provides a fuzzy and crisp CLARA algorithm to cluster large database with sequence analysis.
