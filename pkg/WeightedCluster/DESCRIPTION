Description: Clusters state sequences and weighted data. It provides an optimized weighted PAM algorithm as well as functions for aggregating replicated cases, computing cluster quality measures for a range of clustering solutions, sequence analysis typology validation using parametric bootstraps and plotting (fuzzy) clusters of state sequences. It further provides a fuzzy and crisp CLARA algorithm to cluster large database with sequence analysis, and a methodological framework for Robustness Assessment of Regressions using Cluster Analysis Typologies (RARCAT).
