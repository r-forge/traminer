# Introduction 

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::knit_hooks$set(time_it = local({
  now <- NULL
  function(before, options) {
    if (before) {
      # record the current time before each chunk
      now <<- Sys.time()
    } else {
      # calculate the time difference after a chunk
      res <- difftime(Sys.time(), now, units = "secs")
      # return a character string to show the time
      paste("Time for this code chunk to run:", round(res,
        2), "seconds")
    }
  }
}))

This document provides a very quick introduction to the `R` code needed to use parametric bootstraps for typology validation in sequence analysis. Readers interested in the methods and the exact interpretation of the results are referred to:

- Studer, M. (2021). Validating Sequence Analysis Typologies Using Parametric Bootstraps. *Sociological Methodology 51(2)*, 290--318. https://doi.org/10.1177/00811750211014232 

You are kindly asked to cite the above reference if you use the methods presented in this document. 

**Warning!!** To avoid lengthy computations (and overloading the CRAN server), we restricted the number of bootstraps to 50. We recommend using a higher value (i.e., 1000). 

Let's start by setting the seed for reproducible results.


```{r, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

# Creating the State Sequence Object
For this example, we use the `mvad` dataset. Let's start with the creation of the state sequence object.

```{r, message=FALSE}
## Loading the TraMineR library
library(TraMineR)
## Loading the data
data(mvad)

## State properties
mvad.alphabet <- c("employment", "FE", "HE", "joblessness", "school", "training")
mvad.lab <- c("employment", "further education", "higher education", "joblessness", "school", "training")
mvad.shortlab <- c("EM","FE","HE","JL","SC","TR")

## Creating the state sequence object
mvad.seq <- seqdef(mvad, 17:86, alphabet = mvad.alphabet, states = mvad.shortlab, labels = mvad.lab, xtstep = 6)

```


# Creating the typology

We will now create a typology using cluster analysis. Readers interested in more detail are referred to the `WeightedCluster` library manual (also available as a vignette), which goes into the details of the creation and computation of cluster quality measures. 

We start by computing dissimilarities with the `seqdist` function using the Hamming distance. We then use Ward clustering to create a typology of the trajectories. For this step, we recommend the use of the `fastcluster` library, which considerably speed up the computations.


```{r, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
## Using fastcluster for hierarchical clustering
library(fastcluster)
## Distance computation
diss <- seqdist(mvad.seq, method="HAM")
## Hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(as.dist(diss), method="ward.D")
```

We can now compute several cluster quality indices using `as.clustrange` function from two to ten groups.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Loading the WeightedCluster library
library(WeightedCluster)
# Computing cluster quality measures.
clustqual <- as.clustrange(hc, diss=diss, ncluster=10)
clustqual
```

# Parametric Bootstrap

Parametric bootstrap aims to provide baseline values obtained by clustering *similar* but *non-clustered* data [@Studer2021]. This can be computed using the `seqnullcqi` function with the following parameters:

 - `R`: number of bootstraps.
 - `model`: The null model (see table below
 - `seqdist.args`: list of arguments passed to `seqdist` (should be identical to first call to seqdist).
 - `hclust.method`: hierarchical clustering method (should be identical to orginal clustering).
 - `kmedoid`: If `TRUE`, use PAM (and the `wcKMedRange` function) instead of hierarchical clustering.
 - `parallel`: If `TRUE`, use parallel computing to speed up the computations.


## Combined Randomization
The following `R` code estimate expected values of the cluster quality indices when clustering similar sequences that are not clustered according to the `"combined"` model, using the Hamming distance and Ward hierarchical clustering. We set `parallel=TRUE` to use parallel computing. You can use `progressbar=TRUE` to show a progress bar and an estimation of the computation remaining time (not meaningful here within a document):


```{r}
bcq.combined <- seqnullcqi(mvad.seq, clustqual, R=50, model="combined", seqdist.args=list(method="HAM"), hclust.method="ward.D", parallel = TRUE)
```
 

Once the parametric bootstrap is computed (may take a while...), the results are stored in the `bcq.combined` object. Printing the object (just by writing its name), already provides several information, the standardized cluster quality indices and the associated inconclusive intervals. Here, 2, 9 and 10 groups stand out.

```{r, size="tiny"}
bcq.combined
```

To get non-standardized values, use `norm=FALSE`. Notice that the ASW inconclusive intervals are well below the values recommended by Kaufman and Rousseeuw (over 0.5).


```{r, size="tiny"}
print(bcq.combined, norm=FALSE)
```

Several plots can then be used to inspect the results using the `plot` command and the `type` argument. First, one can look at the sequences generated by the null model by using `type="seqdplot"`. 


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.combined, type="seqdplot")
```

The overall distribution of the CQI values can be plotted using `type="density"`. In this case, one also needs to specify the CQI to be used. All tested number of groups are found to be significant. Any CQI computed by `as.clustrange()` can be used here. To show the density of the average silhouette width (`"ASW"`), one can use:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.combined, stat="ASW", type="density")
```

By using `type="line"`, we plot the obtained and bootstrapped CQI values depending on the number of groups. Here again 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.combined, stat="ASW", type="line")
```


## Randomized Sequencing

To use another null model, one needs to change the `model` argument of the `seqnullcqi` function. The randomized sequencing keep the duration attached to each state, but randomizes the ordering of the spells. It can be used to uncover sequencing structure of the data. 

```{r}
bcq.seq <- seqnullcqi(mvad.seq, clustqual, R=50, model="sequencing", seqdist.args=list(method="HAM"), hclust.method="ward.D", parallel = TRUE)
```

We can then plot the results as before. Notice that solutions between 3 and 6 are below the critical line.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.seq, stat="ASW", type="line")
```



## Randomized Duration

The randomized duration keeps the same ordering of the states, but randomizes the time spent in each spell. It can be used to uncover the duration-related structure of the data. 

```{r}
bcq.dur <- seqnullcqi(mvad.seq, clustqual, R=50, model="duration", seqdist.args=list(method="HAM"), hclust.method="ward.D", parallel = TRUE)
```

We can then plot the results as before. The solutions 3 and 4 groups solutions are below the "significance line". Otherwise, the ranking of the solutions is the same. 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.dur, stat="ASW", type="line")
```

## State Independence

The state independence null model generates sequence, position by position, independently of the previous state. This is a quite unrealistic assumption for longitudinal data, but a common one in statistical modeling.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
bcq.stateindep <- seqnullcqi(mvad.seq, clustqual, R=50, model="stateindep", seqdist.args=list(method="HAM"), hclust.method="ward.D", parallel = TRUE)
```

Bootstrapped CQI values are extremely low compared to our clustering, meaning that we have a strong longitudinal structure (not surprising!).


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.stateindep, stat="ASW", type="line")
```

## First-order Markov Null Model

The first-order Markov null model generates sequences using time-invariant transition rates. As a result, the generated sequences are often quite similar to the observed ones. This model can uncover structure stemming from time-dependent transition rates. 


```{r, cache=TRUE}
bcq.Markov <- seqnullcqi(mvad.seq, clustqual, R=50, model="Markov", seqdist.args=list(method="HAM"), hclust.method="ward.D", parallel = TRUE)
```



```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, results="hide", dev="png"}
plot(bcq.Markov, stat="ASW", type="line")
```


# Choosing a Solution 

The various null models lead to the same conclusions and ranking of the solutions. Solutions between 3 and 6 groups were not always above the critical lines (in the sequencing null model for instance), and can be avoided. We generally saw good clustering quality for a clustering in 9 groups. The solution is shown below.


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=12, results="hide"}
seqdplot(mvad.seq, clustqual$clustering$cluster9, border=NA)
```
