              CHANGES IN WeightedCluster VERSION 0.9-xx

NEW FEATURES
  o seqclustname: automatic labeling of clusters using sequence medoids.
  o Added the WeightedCluster vignette
  o It is now possible to plot the "RHC" statistic computed as 1-HC. This way all statistics should be maximized (Requested by Gilbert Ritschard).
  o Now testing for correct input in "as.clustrange".

BUG FIXES

  o PBC, HG, HC, where computed only on the lower triangular part of the distance matrix (instead on the whole one).
  o Corrected citation informations
  o Many grammar and spelling corrections in the WeightedClusterPreview vignette (thanks to Nevena Zhelyazkova).
