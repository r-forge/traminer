	from a problem of non-uniqueness when two or more distances between
	different clusters coincide during the amalgamation process. The
	traditional approach for solving this drawback has been to take any
	arbitrary criterion in order to break ties between distances, which
	results in different hierarchical classifications depending on the
	criterion followed. In this article we propose a variable-group algorithm
	that consists in grouping more than two clusters at the same time
	when ties occur. We give a tree representation for the results of
	the algorithm, which we call a multidendrogram , as well as a generalization
	of the Lance and Williams' formula which enables the implementation
	of the algorithm in a recursive way.},

  volume = {38},
  pages = {235-264},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Optimal matching (OM) is a method for measuring the similarity between
	pairs of sequences (e.g., work histories). This article discusses
	two problems with optimal matching. First, the author identifies
	a flaw in OM indel costs'' and proposes a solution to this flaw.
	Second, the author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the
	added value of OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the
	author conducts an empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative
	localized OM, and sequence comparison. The test documents the problem
	with traditional OM and shows that it is solved by localized OM.
	The test also demonstrates the value of OM and sequence comparison
	in examining occupational sequences; both methods capture variation
	beyond traditional human capital and status attainment measures,
	although the marginal improvements of OM over sequence comparison
	may not justify its computational complexity. These results point
	to the need for more systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.},

	the a priori structure of the item set defined by a researcher, and
	a graph R that characterizes a subject's protocol. Two indices of
	clustering, denoted by gamma and omega, are obtained by evaluating
	the sum of the pairwise products of the weights on the corresponding
	edges of the two graphs. The gamma statistic is a direct generalization
	of the commonly used clustering indices and reduces to the number
	of repetitions whenever G represents a standard categorical decomposition
	of a stimulus list. The omega statistic, on the other hand, extracts
	more information from the protocol graph R than does gamma and incorporates
	a distance measured based on the number of intervening items in a
	subject's recall sequence.}

  title = {Setting Cost in Optimal Matching to Uncover Contemporaneous Socio-Temporal
	Patterns},
  journal = {Sociological Methods Research},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {38},
  pages = {389-419},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting
	on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover
	when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance
	between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines
	what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion
	and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective
	of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous
	similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs,
	the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions
	are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein
	II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence.
	When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be
	favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally,
	substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account
	the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the
	timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations
	with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies
	whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined
	dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling
	of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time
	use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming
	and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity
	measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as
	measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.},

  abstract = {A review of clustering methodology is presented, with emphasis on
	algorithm performance and the re sulting implications for applied
	research. After an over view of the clustering literature, the clustering
	process is discussed within a seven-step framework. The four major
	types of clustering methods can be characterized as hierarchical,
	partitioning, overlapping, and ordina tion algorithms. The validation
	of such algorithms re fers to the problem of determining the ability
	of the methods to recover cluster configurations which are known
	to exist in the data. Validation approaches in clude mathematical
	derivations, analyses of empirical datasets, and monte carlo simulation
	methods. Next, interpretation and inference procedures in cluster
	anal ysis are discussed. inference procedures involve test ing for
	significant cluster structure and the problem of determining the
	number of clusters in the data. The paper concludes with two sets
	of recommendations. One set deals with topics in clustering that
	would ben efit from continued research into the methodology. The
	other set offers recommendations for applied anal yses within the
	framework of the clustering process.},

	Inspired by the principles of analysis of variance, this approach

	The authors use the pairwise dissimilarities between sequences to
	determine the discrepancy, which makes it possible to develop a series
	of statistical significance-based analysis tools. They introduce
	generalized simple and multifactor discrepancy-based methods to test
	for differences between groups, a pseudo-R 2 for measuring the strength
	of sequence-covariate associations, a generalized Levene statistic
	for testing differences in the within-group discrepancies, as well
	as tools and plots for studying the evolution of the differences
	along the time frame and a regression tree method for discovering
	the most significant discriminant covariates and their interactions.
	In addition, the authors extend all methods to account for case weights.
	The scope of the proposed methodological framework is illustrated
	using a real-world sequence data set.},
